ROLE:
You are an expert AI Web Strategist and Systems Architect. Your task is to generate a complete and detailed blueprint for a new website for a company named "S-Tech Services." Your output should be structured, logical, and optimized for SEO and user experience.
PRIMARY GOAL:
To produce a comprehensive website plan that will serve as the definitive guide for a web developer. The plan must clearly address the company's two distinct business divisions and target audiences.
CONTEXT & ESSENTIAL DATA:
Company Name: S-Tech Services
Established: 2014 (This is a key trust signal and must be featured).
Core Business Area 1 (Local Services): Electronics and mobile phone repairs. This includes screen/battery replacements, refurbishing, flashing, and unlocking. The target audience is local individuals seeking fast, reliable repair services.
Core Business Area 2 (Global Services): High-tech development services. This includes AI-powered full-stack web development and AI-enhanced cross-platform app design. The target audience is businesses, startups, and entrepreneurs worldwide.
Unique Selling Proposition (USP): The rare combination of hands-on hardware repair expertise and sophisticated, AI-driven software development.
KEY CONSTRAINTS & RULES:
Audience Segmentation is Critical: The user journey must immediately and clearly separate visitors seeking "Repairs" from those seeking "Development." This is the most important architectural challenge to solve.
SEO Optimization: The structure must be inherently SEO-friendly. Address both Local SEO (for repairs, using geographic keywords) and Global, Authority-Based SEO (for development, using technical and service-based keywords).
Trust and Credibility: The plan must incorporate elements that build trust, leveraging the "since 2014" history, testimonials, and detailed service descriptions.
Technology Stack: The plan should assume the website will be built on a user-friendly CMS (like WordPress) to allow for easy content updates by the client.
Core Principles: The final website must be mobile-first, load quickly, and be secure (HTTPS).
EXECUTION: STEP-BY-STEP TASK BREAKDOWN
Generate the website blueprint by completing the following tasks in order:
Task 1: Define the Complete Website Sitemap
Create a hierarchical list of all necessary pages and their parent/child relationships.
Task 2: Design the Homepage Structure and Content Blocks
Detail the layout of the homepage, section by section, from top to bottom. For each section, specify its purpose and the key content/call-to-action (CTA) it should contain. The "Audience Splitter" section is mandatory and should be near the top.
Task 3: Detail the Content and Structure for Key Pages
For each of the main pages defined in the sitemap, outline the essential sections, content, and specific CTAs.
Electronics & Mobile Repairs Page: Must include a list of common repairs, a statement on quality, and a "Get a Free Quote" form/button.
AI-Powered Web Development Page: Must detail the process, technologies used, benefits of AI integration, and a "Schedule a Consultation" CTA.
AI-Enhanced App Development Page: Must highlight cross-platform capabilities, showcase the AI advantage, and include a "Discuss Your App Idea" CTA.
About Us Page: Must tell the company's story, emphasizing the 2014 origin and the dual expertise.
Task 4: Outline the Portfolio & Case Studies Section
Describe the structure of the portfolio. It must include a filtering mechanism to allow users to view "Repair Projects" or "Development Projects."
Specify the content format for a Development Case Study (e.g., Client, Problem, Solution, Technologies Used, Outcome).
Specify the content format for a Repair Example (e.g., Device, Issue, Before/After Images, Customer Testimonial).
Task 5: Propose a Foundational SEO & Content Strategy
Keyword Strategy: Provide 5 example local SEO keywords for the repair service (e.g., "iPhone screen repair in [City]") and 5 example global keywords for the development services (e.g., "AI-powered ecommerce development").
Blog Strategy: Propose 3 blog post titles for the "Repair" category and 3 blog post titles for the "Development" category to demonstrate content strategy for both audiences.
OUTPUT FORMAT:
Generate the output as a single, comprehensive document using Markdown for clear formatting.
Use ## for main headings (e.g., ## Task 1: Website Sitemap) and ### for subheadings.
Use bullet points for lists and details.
Ensure the response is well-organized and directly follows the task breakdown provided above.
Execute the plan
